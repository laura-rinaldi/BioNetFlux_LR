\newcommand{\arc}{S}

Discrete trial and test functions $w$ in $H^1(\arc)$, $\arc$ being an arc of the geometry, are represented both as trace vectors (that is the vector of values of $w$ in the {\tt N\_nodes} nodes of the spatial discretization), and as discontinuous P1 functions, represented by a couple of coefficients per elements.
